    Main function that handles support for systems of chemical reactions. In order, this function:

    Helper function for converting the expressions for the extra terms into runnable code for the reaction file.

    Three types of expressions are supported:

    1.  A closed form expression, potentially involving math operations For example:

            a: 3
            b: sin(2*pi/0.12)

    2.  A closed form expression involving **other extra terms**. For example:

            radius: 10
            area:   pi * radius**2

    **Note: The order of terms is important. A term must be first defined before being used.**
    The above example is valid, but the example below is **not** valid since `radius` is used before being defined.

            area:   pi * radius**2
            radius: 10

    3.  Load a result in the native format of the CFD software used for creating the hydrodynamics.
        The format is:

            CFD, file_name

        The CFD keyword specifies to read the specific file in the CFD's native format.
        The file is assumed to in the same folder as the hydrodynamics result.
        Those results are then mapped to a numpy array that is indexed by the global degree of freedom.

    Parameters
    ----------
    * config_parser:        OpenCMP config parser to read values from.
    * dof_to_element_map:   Mapping between degree of freedom and the ordered lists of tuples representing the elements
                            that this dof maps to. Tuple contains (element ID, dof_other, weight_this).

                            this dof and the nearest (dof_other).
    * extra_terms_str:      Mapping between the name of the extra terms and the string representation of their value.
    * _ddt_reshape_shape:   Shape needed by _ddt for PFR systems so that the inlet node does not have a reaction occurring at it.

    Returns
    -------
    * A string representation for the python code required for loading these extra terms by the reaction file.

    """
    Parses all reactions and rates and creates the differential reaction system of equations.
    See the Notes section below for further description of expectations and limitations of the reactions configuration parser.

    Notes
    -----
    -   The reaction parser only supports forward (written) reactions (i.e. use of ->).
        Reversible reactions must be written as two independent reactions with their associated rate constants.
    -   The reactions parser can parse the general reaction: aA1 + bB2 + [...] -> gG7 + hH8 + [...].
    -   All chemical species must be alphanumeric.
        -   We recommend using "m" or "p" for + and - ions, respectively.
            I.e.: Na+ should be written as Nap in the reactions and main configuration file.

    An appropriate reactions configuration file for the reversible reaction N2O4 <-> 2NO2 with k_f = 1e-2 and k_r = 3e-4 (these are hypothetical rates) would be:
        [REACTIONS]
        R1: N2O4 -> 2NO2
        R2: 2NO2 -> N2O4

        [RATE CONSTANTS]
        R1: 1e-2
        R2: 3e-4

    Parameters
    ----------
    * all_reactions:        Mapping between reaction number and the unparsed reaction.
    * all_rate_constants:   Mapping between reaction number and the unparsed rate constant.

    Returns
