For running this simulation in your system you have to follow these steps :

1 - Mesh has been created using Gmsh and you will need to convert it to OpenFOAM mesh format. First, save the mesh in .msh format and then use command <gmshToFoam mesh_name.msh> for our case it would be <gmshToFoam pipe_recirc_structured.msh> to convert it into OpenFOAM mesh format.

2 - You will get the folder named 'constant'. You will need to make changes in file <constant/polyMesh/boundary>. change the patch type for each physical surfaces. for this case :
	(
    top_and_bottom
    {
        type            empty;
    }
    wall
    {
        type            wall;
    }
    inlet
    {
        type            patch;
    }
    outlet
    {
        type            patch;
    }
	)
	 NOTE - Please don't change the "nFaces" and "startFace" value for each physical surface.
	 
Now you are done with the mesh conversion.

4 -  If necessary, make parameter adjustments in the 'system/controlDict' file. However, you may not need to modify parameters in this file for most cases.
     Optionally, you can make changes to the numerical schemes used by modifying the 'system/fvSchemes' and 'system/fvSolution' files.

5 - Now, just write command <simpleFoam> in terminal to run openfoam simulation.

Please ensure that you have OpenFOAM installed and properly configured on your system before following these steps. Additionally, adjust any simulation-specific parameters or settings as needed for your specific case.
